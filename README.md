# Weather-dashboard
## Description 
For this week's challenge I have to create a webpage that can display the weather in multiple cities for a traveler to plan their trip accordingly.

 ## Acceptance Criteria
* GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
* WHEN I search for a city
* THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
* WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
* THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
* WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
* THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
* WHEN I click on a city in the search history
* THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

 ## Work completed
 * Created html with Boostrap structure 
 * Register for Weather API key from https://openweathermap.org/forecast5
 * Got API working for website as far as fetching the information needed
 * Created search box and button, link javascript to automatically search my area which is Hartford CT, if you search another city it'll work as well
